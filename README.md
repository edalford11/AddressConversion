AddressConversion
=================

Unix-like command line	utility that	will	convert	between	three	different	address	types when	an	address of	a	 different	type	is given. Specifications for the utility are as follows: 
AddressConversion -L|-P|-C [–b offset] [-B [-s bytes]] [-l address] [- p address] [-c address -k sectors -r sectors -t tables -f sectors] 
  -L, --logical Calculate the logical address from either the cluster address or the physical address. Either –c or –p must be given. 
  -P, --physical Calculate the physical address from either the cluster address  or the logical address. Either –c or –l must be given. 
  -C, --cluster Calculate the cluster address from either the logical address or  the physical address. Either –l or –p must be given. 
  -b offset, --partition-start=offset This specifies the physical address (sector number) of the start  of the partition, and defaults to 0 for ease in working with  images of a single partition. The offset value will always  translate into logical address 0. 
  -B, --byte-address Instead of returning sector values for the conversion, this  returns the byte address of the calculated value, which is the  number of sectors multiplied by the number of bytes per sector. 
  -s bytes, --sector-size=bytes When the –B option is used, this allows for a specification of  bytes per sector other than the default 512. Has no affect on  output without –B. 
  -l address, --logical-known=address This specifies the known logical address for calculating either  a cluster address or a physical address. When used with the –L  option, this simply returns the value given for address. 
  -p address, --physical-known=address This specifies the known physical address for calculating either  a cluster address or a logical address. When used with the –P  option, this simply returns the value given for address. 
  -c address, --cluster-known=address This specifies the known cluster address for calculating either  a logical address or a physical address. When used with the –C  option, this simply returns the value given for address. Note  that options –k, -r, -t, and –f must be provided with this  option. 
  -k sectors, --cluster-size=sectors This specifies the number of sectors per cluster. 
  -r sectors, --reserved=sectors This specifies the number of reserved sectors in the partition. 
  -t tables, --fat-tables=tables This specifies the number of FAT tables, which is usually 2. 
  -f sectors, --fat-length=sectors This specifies the length of each FAT table in sectors.
